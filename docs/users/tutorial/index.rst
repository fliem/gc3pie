  GC3Pie usage tutorials
--------------------------

The following slides provide an overview of GC3Pie features and usage
from a users' perspective.  They are used in the `GC3Pie for users`__
training held regularly at the University of Zurich. (Thus, they may
contain references to local infrastructure or systems but should be
comprehensible and -hopefully- useful for a more general audience as
well.)
